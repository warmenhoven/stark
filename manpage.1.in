.SH NAME
@PROGNAME@ \- displays financial data
.SH SYNOPSIS
@PROGNAME@ <data-file>
.SH USAGE
GnuCash leaves behind dozens of .xac and .log files; in case you haven't
paid attention to the GnuCash documentation, those are just backup files
(the .log files aren't even that) and you can ignore them or do whatever you
want to with them. I remove mine after committing the changes to CVS.

If it complains about anything and doesn't show you an account list, odds
are there's a problem with your GnuCash data. Either that or you've got
something I don't use like AP or AR. Hopefully there's enough information in
the error message for you to open your data file in an editor and track down
where the problem is.
