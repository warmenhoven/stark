1. What it does

   stark is a curses-based tool to display your gnucash data. It displays
   current account balances, values of holdings, and account registers.

2. How to compile it

   There is a Makefile included that should build stark without any problems.
   stark depends on expat and curses.

3. How to use it

   ./stark <gnucash-data-file>

   GnuCash leaves behind dozens of .xac and .log files; in case you haven't
   paid attention to the GnuCash documentation, those are just backup files
   (the .log files aren't even that) and you can ignore them or do whatever you
   want to with them. I remove mine after committing the changes to CVS.

4. That's it?

   stark doesn't do any real reporting, and doesn't let you modify the data.
   That makes it pretty useless, except for when you're out and only have ssh
   access and need to see how much money you have. Here's a quick TODO list:

	* display splits
	* reporting
	* reload from file
	* editable

   I don't know if and when I'll ever get to this. Feel free to send a patch.
   stark is public domain so feel free not to.
